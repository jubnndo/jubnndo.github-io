#### Types of Websites

Static VS Dynamic Web sites

Static websites are ones that **are fixed and display the same content for every user**, usually written exclusively in HTML. A dynamic website, on the other hand, is one that can display different content and provide user interaction, by making use of advanced programming and databases in addition to HTML.

#### Creating a Website in Github Pages

GitHub is a **code hosting platform for version control and collaboration**. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. 

GitHub Pages is **a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files** straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. ... You can host your site on GitHub's github.io domain or your own custom domain.

The purpose of GitHub Pages is to provide the GitHub user a way to create personal websites for themselves and websites for their projects/repositories. For each registered GitHub account (representing a user or an organization) you can register one User Page, but an unlimited Project page.
